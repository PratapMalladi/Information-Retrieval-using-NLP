## Business Objective:

## To Predict 5 best matching answers from the Product info, Q & A's reviews.The idea is to essentially try to replicate what Online Market Place firms does with its reviews. 

For example from reviews of a given product, Online Market place, extracts key-words and then allows users to search comments by these key-words. NLP, is an attempt to make a computer understand human language. Computers can easily understand programming languages. 

## Before getting into the problem have gone through available research papers on the business problem context because I feel working in data science and machine learning is an exciting and challenging field. New techniques and tools are constantly percolating and honestly, it can feel overwhelming. Many of these new developments are found and first revealed in academic research articles. Extracting knowledge from these articles is difficult because the intended audience of these papers tend to be other researchers. Yet in order to stay current reading papers is an essential skill â€” luckily one that can be improved with diligence and practice.
